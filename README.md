# Text-2-Image

# We developed this project using stable diffusion model (version V1-4), Enhanced with low Ranking LLM (LORA) for rapid training and high resolution outputs. 
# Stable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model that can create photorealistic visuals from any word input
'''The jewellery business, which
relies on designers’ expertise and creativity, is on the verge of a
dramatic shift with the integration of AI-driven technologies. Our
proposed approach serves as a creative middleman, combining
consumer preferences and artistic ideas to provide a wide range
of jewellery pictures. By allowing customers to choose from
these AI-generated designs, the technology not only meets their
expectations but also dramatically streamlines the designer’s
productivity.'''
